### Neural Network Analysis

In this project, I compare a Neural network algorithm to a KNN (K-Nearest-Neighbor) algorithm. I compare in terms of how both algorithms work, and their efficiency with respect to time. This is all within the programming language of R. As stated on my front page, I am a neurotech fanatic! So in this project, I also include how neural networks are related to biological neurons and how they have the same "firing" effect. I created two data sets and compared the efficiency and then referenced two real data sets and then compared the efficiency.

### Snake game

I created a fun minimalist snake game. I often like to play older retro games and arcade games. This is something that I would like to showcase as it is something I would eventually like to get into later on in my future. I am very fascinated by game development in terms of animation and physics. This is actually one of the first projects I have ever done in game development. Click the link below to check it out!
