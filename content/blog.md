# What is it like to build a Mixed Reality Application with no Experience!

## You can do it too!


### Overview
- Microsoftâ€™s Hololens 2 is a mixed reality headset capable of overlaying virtual objects within the real world. This differs from what you would see within a [Virtual reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality) (VR) headset. In a VR headset, your whole reality is replaced with virtual objects. Furthermore, mixed reality headsets like the Hololens 2, have a ton of applications. Whether that be for business, healthcare, education, or even entertainment, there is really no limit to what you could develop for. Fortunately, I had the opportunity and pleasure of not only using the Hololens 2 but also got to create and deploy an app to the headset. Here is my experience with the development process as well as some steps to do it yourself.
