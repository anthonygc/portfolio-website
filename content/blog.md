# What is it like to build a Mixed Reality Application with no Experience!

## You can do it too!


### Overview
- Microsoft’s Hololens 2 is a mixed reality headset capable of overlaying virtual objects within the real world. This differs from what you would see within a [Virtual reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality) (VR) headset. In a VR headset, your whole reality is replaced with virtual objects. Furthermore, mixed reality headsets like the Hololens 2, have a ton of applications. Whether that be for business, healthcare, education, or even entertainment, there is really no limit to what you could develop for. Fortunately, I had the opportunity and pleasure of not only using the Hololens 2 but also got to create and deploy an app to the headset. Here is my experience with the development process as well as some steps to do it yourself.

### Streight out of the Box
- When starting my internship at [Sears think[box]](https://case.edu/thinkbox/) I knew that I was going to be working with some expensive equipment. The Hololens 2 is not meant for consumers and is priced around $5000. This is the main reason why I haven’t developed anything within the Mixed Reality sector. I mean, there aren’t many mixed reality headsets in general other than Microsoft’s Hololen’s. But upon unboxing the headsets, it was so amazing to lay eyes on. It had the scent of what you would smell in a new car and the box that it was in portrayed a colorful and vibrant hummingbird levitating in the palms of someone’s hand. It was quite exuberating to see the headset itself. This luxurious piece of equipment made you look futuristic upon wearing it. Of course, because of the price tag and the clean look of the tech, I realized that developing for it may be very daunting. Furthermore, I had very little experience when developing for virtual reality. But I knew some things about the game engine [Unity](https://unity.com/) (a game engine owned by Microsoft). I also figured that the documentation might be good since Microsoft itself is known for having detailed and robust documentation as well as learning modules.
