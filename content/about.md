I am currently an undergraduate student with a major in computer science and a minor in Chinese. Although, I have a passion for neuroscience and analyzing details about the brain from a computational and mathematical standpoint. That said, I am assisting in research under the neuroscience department at Allegheny Collge to understand the effects of stress on alcohol abuse in females vs males. My interests also reach further into the field of brain computer interfaces. I'm am fascinated by how such a concept works. From signal acquisition, signal processing and output, I hopefully want to be able to learn about each step in the process. Furthermore, I hope to one day be able to work in industry where innovations are made in brain computer interfaces.

Some of my favorite hobbies include calisthenics, dancing, 3D modeling, and basketball. Although, I am pretty new to 3D modeling, thus, I don't have many projects yet. I have been a fan of basketball and a player ever since I was an adolescent at the age of 6 years old. My passion for basketball also led to my passion for physical physique. Hence, why I like calsithenics, plyometrics and general health. With better health comes the ability to do more with your body. I often express myself phsyically not only in basketball but also in dancing. I love "Footwork". This style of dance is popular among individuals living in urban areas. It originated from Chicago in the 90's. To me, footwork is visualy apealling and a style that is high energy. This energy merely represents my character. This is due to the fact that I put in high energy in almost every action I do.
