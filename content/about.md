I am currently an undergraduate student with a major in computer science and a minor in Chinese. Although, I have a passion for neuroscience and analyzing details about the brain from a computational and mathematical standpoint. That said, I am assisting in research under the neuroscience department at Allegheny Collge to understand the effects of stress on alcohol abuse in females vs males. My interests also reach further into the field of brain computer interfaces. I'm am fascinated by how such a concept works. From signal acquisition, signal processing and output, I hopefully want to be able to learn about each step in the process. Furthermore, I hope to one day be able to work in industry where innovations are made in brain computer interfaces.

Some of my favorite hobbies include calisthenics, dancing, 3D modeling in blender, and basketball. Although, I am pretty new to 3D modeling, thus, I don't have many projects yet. My favorite basketball team is the Toronto Raptors.
