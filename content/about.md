I am currently an undergraduate student with a major in computer science and a minor in Chinese. Although, I have a passion for neuroscience and analyzing computational details about the brain. That said, I am assisting in research under the neuroscience department to understand the effects of stress on alcohol abuse in females vs males. Some of my favorite hobbies include calisthenics and 3D modeling in blender.
